# 3D-featurizer-metalloenzyme
This repository houses my 3D featurizer of metallo-enzyme proteins. It takes in PDB files and the center of mass of binding site metals/metals, while it outputs discrete grid array in which each grid point is bit that denotes whether a specific atom type is present or absent
